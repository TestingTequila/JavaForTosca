-Statements
 Whenever we have to make decisions, we use statements
 - if statement
    SYNTAX:
   if(condition)
   {
     // This code will execute only if condition is true
   }

   => condition should always result a boolean value

   Issues:
   -Its not handling the failed condition
   -Its time consuming even if condition matches


 - if else statement
   if(condition)
   {
      This code will execute only if condition is true
   }
   else
    {
      This code will execute if condition is false
    }
 - if else if statement
 - switch statement
